## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AJKaur02/Challenge-13-E-Commerce-Back-End
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd e-commerce-backend
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
      ```env
      DB_NAME=your_database_name
      DB_USER=your_postgres_username
      DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_PORT=5432
      ```
    - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to ensure it is not tracked by Git.

5. **Create the database:**
    - Use the `schema.sql` file to create your database:
      ```bash
      psql -U your_postgres_username -f db/schema.sql
      ```

6. **Seed the database with test data:**
    ```bash
    node seeds/seed.js
    ```

7. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
